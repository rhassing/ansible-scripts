To use ssh access to the controller, you could create a certificate:
openssl req -x509 -key ~/.ssh/id_rsa -days 1500 -newkey rsa:2048 -out ~/.ssh/root_pub.pem

This command creates a certificate from you ssh rsa key. (generated by ssh-keygen)

This cirtificate can be imported into the controller (by webgui)

SSH key login must be enabled.

Add a user with certificate login and choose the uploaded certificate.
